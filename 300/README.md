# 300 - Building Our Application

TRANSSCRIPT

Watch how I set up a folder to be a terraform solution 

I create a variables file.

I declare main.

I declare an outputs

Terraform works up a folder, takes inputs, and produces outputs.

I run terraform units and it loads providers and downloads modules per on terraform plan.

Plan is a read-only operation that analyzes dependencies and sequences a plan of steps to execute across all the providers you play within your solution.

I run terraform apply.

Apply executes that plan and returns outputs from prospective resources.

That's it
